### Kudos

Special thanks to:

* [Granze](https://github.com/Granze)/[lastfm-card](https://github.com/Granze/lastfm-card) for creating the first Polymer element I've seen, much of this repository is a hack of his.
* [JoelSutherland](https://github.com/JoelSutherland)/[GitHub jQuery Repo Widget](https://github.com/JoelSutherland/GitHub-jQuery-Repo-Widget) for the elements design template, the parent project this element was refactored from.

### Roadmap

There are a few things that would be lovely to see:

* API authentication support
* Theme support
